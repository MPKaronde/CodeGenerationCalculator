Hello. 

This is a program meant to create a calcuator generated by you (ollama)

Shortly I will be giving you the name of an operation to produce, and you will, to the best of your abilities
provide me with a python function to complete that operation upon two integers, including the function declaration, body, and return statement.

The integers in question will be global variables named x and y. The output will be set to a third global variable named z, as well as being returned by the function.
Assume this will all be run in the scope of a python program

from here on out, I would you to give me nothing except for the apporpriate function or an error if you cant do that
